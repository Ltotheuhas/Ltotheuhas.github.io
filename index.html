<p align=" justify">I don’t live out of a personal drive I just can’t allow myself to have my mom experience my suicide.
    Other than her there are absolutely people who I want to do that too. For the most part I would prefer if I was dead in
    people’s minds. Have my existence be past tense. That way people can cherish the good things my existence might
    have brought to them. Additionally everyone besides my mom would be fine. I’m not at the point of the
    stereotypical depressive thought of everyone being better off without me, I simply think they would be fine with
    or without me. My mom is the exception because she really doesn’t have anything besides me. Her accidentally
    getting pregnant with me gave her purpose in a time where she was in her 30s in a foreign country with no
    direction. My death would instill pain on her I couldn’t imagine. My father couldn’t be fucked either way so I
    would be okay with him feeling the guilt of his neglect son killing himself. My friends don’t need me. I’m not
    actually close with anyone anyway. I can’t relate to anyone anyway. Nobody can relate to me anyway. So I might
    as well be a memory to them instead of continuing to have to roleplay myself into being integrated anywhere
    socially. I am the weirdest fuck alive. I feel like the weirdest fuck alive all the time. When I talk people
    think I'm weird. When they look at me people think I'm weird. When I present myself people think I'm weird. I
    made up entire relationships to my friends in order to cover up my shame. It's legitimately difficult to not
    fabricate parts of my life simply because of how pathetic I really am as a person. I lied about a drug life I
    never had. I have nothing that I want my life to be. I don't have anything that I want to strive towards. I
    really don't want to have art shit bei a career since I don't even see myself as a proper fucking artist.
    Everything I make is to cope with my feelings. I'm not particularly skilled or have confidence in my skills in
    everything I touched on artistically in my time. I'm not sure if I would want anything I did to be anything more
    than a hobby anyway. But at the same time that shit is the only thing I actually want to do at times. I hate
    careers. I don't want to decide on something I do for the remainder of my life. I don't have the energy or
    ambition to work towards any goals in the first place. I have nothing in me. Having been socially isolated for a
    better part of my life has crippled my ability to enjoy life and will most likely be a burden I will carry for a
    better part of my remaining life. I cannot exit social situations without still feeling alone. I can’t actually
    be alone while being contempt unless I distract myself with stupid shit. I'm incredibly uncomfortable with
    myself and that bleeds into how I interact with people. I can’t help but feel like I subconsciously put on a
    show for people to hide my authentic self out of shame. I have so little confidence in myself that I feel the
    need to adjust how I present myself according to who I’m interacting with. Part of me genuinely won’t accept
    that people like me. I feel like I treat the people around me unfairly too by being the way I am. I make it
    incredibly difficult for people to connect with me and I feel like people realise that. I don’t think I will
    ever truly feel comfortable around another person unless I fundamentally change who I am as a person as all of
    this shit dates back to the way I was brought up and lived for my entire life. I fucking hate that and I hate
    life for having to deal with that. It’s hard to blindly practice self love when you’re so hyper aware of all
    your faults. Suicidal fantasies for no fucking reason. I fantasize about killing myself in front of people. I
    wish I could kill myself and then see how everyone that knows me reacts from the afterlife. I want to be dead to
    people. I don’t want to carry myself anymore. I sincerely don’t care about myself. I wish I would. I realise
    it’s just something in my brain that makes me think that. It’s hard to differentiate when it’s me and when it’s
    that something else that’s placing thoughts down. This is the worst. Cause it’s like why do you love me. I don’t
    even do shit. I don’t live life. I don’t travel with my partner. I don’t have finals to worry about, I’m not
    even done with highschool. I don’t work. If I had to worry about the latter two I would probably feel even worse
    about myself. I just don’t see myself as resilient at fucking all. I have nothing I strive for I don’t have
    goals I don’t have anything I don’t have any plans for myself except wanting to be dead. How the fuck could you
    possibly like me then. I had a dream where it was warm outside and various friends of mine were just hanging out at
    my place while my mom was doing something else but I went to take a nap insident dream so they got bored and went
    something else so when I was done with my nap I went and biked over to where they went while having a wholeass
    adventure on the bike ride. It felt so natural. That dreamt life had something so casual about it. Like that was
    what life is supposed to feel like. Just being excited to bike to your friends. It’s like I view my actual life
    trough some desaturated filter that doesn’t allow me to feel such simple joys. The highlights of my daily routine
    currently are watching the most stimulating youtube video I can. Just whatever passes the best. Simply what helps me
    not feel like shit for a while the best. This shit has complete control over how I live my life.</p>
